# IRCIOBridge
[![Last GitHub Workflow Run](https://github.com/TheDaemoness/IRCIOBridge/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://actions-badge.atrox.dev/TheDaemoness/IRCIOBridge/goto)

A simple Java library for providing drop-in IRC functionality into existing Java programs that use `System.in`/`System.out` for a significant portion of their I/O.
Intended to be (relatively) easy to use for novice programmers.
